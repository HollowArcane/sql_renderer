+ do not create external functions
+ fix constant_map by storing expression instead of variables, this will allow to register gleam constants as well as gleam external functions
+ turn registry into a custom type for easy refactoring
+ do a little bit of clean up
+ add variable declarations
+ add expressions
- in constant registering, if the constant is referencing another existing item, it can cause problems if the referenced is not yet registered, order is importaant
- make sure to take into account function arguments when naming new variables
- do case statements

- find a way to handle global variables like TG_OP
- find a way to generate a trigger or a procedure

- make registry scope based
-! handle variable autonaming for unnamed function argument

- set Array as List alias for better DX
- handle errors
- handle function body
- allow tuples?
- allow lists
- create constant mapping registry for constants, type aliases and externals
- allow use of custom types as table / custom psql types
- make a scope based assignment optimisation
- reorder function call arguments based on label

- allow callbacks maybe?
- allow use sugar
- allow assert as raise exception ?
